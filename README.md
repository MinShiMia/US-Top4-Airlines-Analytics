# III. Assessment of Financial Performance of Top 4 Airlines
Airlines' financial health is commonly assessed through net income and operating profit or loss metrics. 

## Net Income Analysis
Net income represents the total profit or loss after all expenses, including taxes and interest, are deducted.

### Net Income Over Years by Airline
Over the past 20 years, the top four airlines have experienced periods of negative or low net income, notably during the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Net Income of Top 4 Airlines by Year during 2002-2023
![Figure 2](https://MinShiMia.github.io/US-Top4-Airlines-Analytics/Tables_Figures/Top4_NetInc.png)

***American Airlines' Financial Challenges:***
Specifically, American Airlines displayed net income around zero or below from 2002 to 2014. This can be attributed not only to general economic downturns but also to high debt levels and the airline's bankruptcy and restructuring in 2011. Historically, American Airlines faced higher labor costs compared to its peers, and it was among the few that had not renegotiated labor agreements post-9/11, leading to a burdensome cost structure. Operational inefficiencies, including flight delays and poor customer service, further eroded its profitability. However, post-merger with US Airways in 2013, its financial situation showed signs of improvement.

***Delta Air Lines' Strategic Shift:***
Delta Air Lines' net income trends reveal dips during the 2008 financial crisis and the pandemic, with a notable increase in 2013. Post-merger with Northwest Airlines in 2010, despite reducing jet fuel consumption, Delta's fuel costs escalated, significantly impacting expenses. In response, Delta acquired an oil refinery in 2012, significantly reducing its fuel costs and helping stabilize future financial outcomes.

***United Airlines' Volatility:***
United Airlines has shown the most fluctuation in net income. For instance, it reported a significant loss in 2005 but recovered in 2006. The airline's financial struggles included high labor costs and operational inefficiencies, exacerbated by the Chapter 11 bankruptcy from December 2002 to February 2006. Post-bankruptcy, United implemented significant cost reductions including labor renegotiations and fleet optimization, which contributed to a financial turnaround by 2007.

***Southwest Airlines' Stability:***
Southwest Airlines has demonstrated the most stable net income over the past two decades, as illustrated in Figure 3. From 2002 to 2023, Southwest was the only airline to consistently report positive net income from its domestic operations. This indicates that the Southwest adopted a relatively successful business model which we will discuss in detail later. 

In summary, while each airline has faced unique challenges, strategic decisions and market focus have played crucial roles in determining their financial trajectories over the past two decades.

### Total Net Income by Airline and Region

Unlike its peers, ***Southwest*** primarily focuses on domestic routes and its net income is the highest among the top 4 airlines. Key factors contributing to its steady financial performance include an aggressive fuel hedging strategy, the operation of a single aircraft type (Boeing 737), a point-to-point routing model, and low-cost operations. These strategies have enabled Southwest to maintain lower operational costs and higher profitability in domestic markets compared to its competitors.

***American Airlines***, over the past twenty years, has experienced significant financial challenges, with a substantial net loss, particularly in domestic operations, amounting to nearly -$8,000,000. This is followed by operations across the Atlantic, showing losses of -$3,000,000, and Pacific operations, with losses around -$2,500,000. However, American Airlines earns the most from local flight operations compared to the other top three airlines.

***Delta Airline*** has incurred a total negative net income of approximately -$2,000,000 in local flight operations. Its domestic flights also faced losses, albeit smaller. Notably, Delta's operations across the Pacific Ocean have generated the highest positive net income among the top four airlines, and it has also achieved positive net income from flights across the Atlantic Ocean. Overall, Delta has performed well in transcontinental operations.

Lastly, ***United Airlines*** has recorded positive net income only from its flights across the Atlantic, while facing losses in domestic, local, and Pacific operations. However, it is worth mentioning that United earns the most from its across-Atlantic Ocean flights among the top four airlines.

Figure 9 US Top 4 Airlines’ Operating Revenue during 2002-2023
![Figure 9](https://MinShiMia.github.io/US-Top4-Airlines-Analytics/Tables_Figures/Top4_OpeRev.png)

The operating revenue seems to be increasing over time for all four airlines, with the exception of a major dip in 2020, as shown in Figure 9. This suggests an overall positive trend in revenue generation, but also vulnerability to external factors.

***Delta Airlines*** appears to have the highest operating revenue throughout the years shown in the chart, followed by American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines. There seems to be a slight gap between the top 3 airlines (Delta, American, United) and Southwest Airlines.

The factors drive Delta Airlines' leading in operating revenue include: 
1) The successful merger with Northwest Airlines in 2008 created a larger, more competitive airline with a wider route network and increased operational efficiency.
2) Network Optimization: Delta have strategically added new routes to high-demand destinations.
3) Revenue Management Improvements: Delta have implemented advanced revenue management practices.

## Analyzing Top 4 Airline’s Passenger Transportation Revenue by Region
Although Southwest has relatively lower total and subcategory revenues compared to the other top three airlines, it is important to note that Southwest focuses exclusively on the U.S. domestic market. Additionally, they operate fewer average roundtrip flights and have fewer total routes per day, serving significantly fewer airports, as detailed in Table 2.

![Table2](https://MinShiMia.github.io/US-Top4-Airlines-Analytics/Tables_Figures/Table2.png)

Since passenger transportation revenue is the most important component of total revenue, we divide the top 4 airlines’ passenger transportation revenue by regions and the results is shown in Figure 10. It is evident that Southwest operates solely in domestic and local regions, whereas the other top three airlines also serve across-Atlantic and across-Pacific regions. Despite focusing exclusively on the domestic market, Southwest's total passenger transportation revenue ranks third, closely trailing American Airlines and Delta Airlines.
