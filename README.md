•	Understanding the US airline industry requires considering the interplay between dominant players, diverse competitors, external factors like fuel costs and regulations, and the ever-evolving technological landscape. As the industry navigates these challenges and opportunities, its future lies in embracing efficiency, innovation, and a focus on the evolving needs of passengers.

## Assessment of Financial Performance of Top 4 Airlines
Airlines' financial health is commonly assessed through net income and operating profit or loss metrics. 

### Net Income Analysis
Net income represents the total profit or loss after all expenses, including taxes and interest, are deducted.

#### Net Income Over Years by Airline
Over the past 20 years, the top four airlines have experienced periods of negative or low net income, notably during the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, as shown in Figure 2.

![Figure 2 Net Income of Top 4 Airlines by Year during 2002-2023!](https://MinShiMia.github.io/US-Top4-Airlines-Analytics/Tables_Figures/Top4_NetInc.png)

***American Airlines' Financial Challenges:***
Specifically, American Airlines displayed net income around zero or below from 2002 to 2014. This can be attributed not only to general economic downturns but also to high debt levels and the airline's bankruptcy and restructuring in 2011. Historically, American Airlines faced higher labor costs compared to its peers, and it was among the few that had not renegotiated labor agreements post-9/11, leading to a burdensome cost structure. Operational inefficiencies, including flight delays and poor customer service, further eroded its profitability. However, post-merger with US Airways in 2013, its financial situation showed signs of improvement.

***Delta Air Lines' Strategic Shift:***
Delta Air Lines' net income trends reveal dips during the 2008 financial crisis and the pandemic, with a notable increase in 2013. Post-merger with Northwest Airlines in 2010, despite reducing jet fuel consumption, Delta's fuel costs escalated, significantly impacting expenses. In response, Delta acquired an oil refinery in 2012, significantly reducing its fuel costs and helping stabilize future financial outcomes.

***United Airlines' Volatility:***
United Airlines has shown the most fluctuation in net income. For instance, it reported a significant loss in 2005 but recovered in 2006. The airline's financial struggles included high labor costs and operational inefficiencies, exacerbated by the Chapter 11 bankruptcy from December 2002 to February 2006. Post-bankruptcy, United implemented significant cost reductions including labor renegotiations and fleet optimization, which contributed to a financial turnaround by 2007.

***Southwest Airlines' Stability:***
Southwest Airlines has demonstrated the most stable net income over the past two decades, as illustrated in Figure 3. From 2002 to 2023, Southwest was the only airline to consistently report positive net income from its domestic operations. This indicates that the Southwest adopted a relatively successful business model which we will discuss in detail later. 

In summary, while each airline has faced unique challenges, strategic decisions and market focus have played crucial roles in determining their financial trajectories over the past two decades.

#### Total Net Income by Airline and Region

Unlike its peers, ***Southwest*** primarily focuses on domestic routes and its net income is the highest among the top 4 airlines. Key factors contributing to its steady financial performance include an aggressive fuel hedging strategy, the operation of a single aircraft type (Boeing 737), a point-to-point routing model, and low-cost operations. These strategies have enabled Southwest to maintain lower operational costs and higher profitability in domestic markets compared to its competitors.

***American Airlines***, over the past twenty years, has experienced significant financial challenges, with a substantial net loss, particularly in domestic operations, amounting to nearly -$8,000,000. This is followed by operations across the Atlantic, showing losses of -$3,000,000, and Pacific operations, with losses around -$2,500,000. However, American Airlines earns the most from local flight operations compared to the other top three airlines.

***Delta Airline*** has incurred a total negative net income of approximately -$2,000,000 in local flight operations. Its domestic flights also faced losses, albeit smaller. Notably, Delta's operations across the Pacific Ocean have generated the highest positive net income among the top four airlines, and it has also achieved positive net income from flights across the Atlantic Ocean. Overall, Delta has performed well in transcontinental operations.

Lastly, ***United Airlines*** has recorded positive net income only from its flights across the Atlantic, while facing losses in domestic, local, and Pacific operations. However, it is worth mentioning that United earns the most from its across-Atlantic Ocean flights among the top four airlines.

### Operating Profit or Loss Analysis
Operating profit or loss is the profit or loss from core business operations, excluding investments, taxes, or interest expenses. 

#### Operating Profit or Loss Over Years by Airline
![Figure 4](https://MinShiMia.github.io/US-Top4-Airlines-Analytics/Tables_Figures/Top4_Ope_Pro_Per_Airline.png)

As shown in Figure 4, the trends for US top 4 airlines are similar. Among the top 4 airlines, Delta Air Lines emerged as the most profitable airline between 2011 and 2019 due to a combination of strategic initiatives and operational efficiencies:

•	Fuel Hedging: Delta’s acquisition of an oil refinery in 2012 helped manage volatile fuel costs more effectively than competitors.

•	Fleet Modernization: Upgrading to newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft reduced maintenance and operational costs.

•	Operational Excellence: High performance in on-time arrivals, customer satisfaction, and baggage handling enhanced brand reputation and reduced costs.

•	Customer Service and Brand Loyalty: Investments in in-flight experiences and loyalty programs enhanced customer retention.

•	Strategic Partnerships: Joint ventures with international carriers expanded Delta’s global network and market reach.

•	Cost Discipline: Despite growth investments, Delta maintained strict control over operating expenses.

•	Economic Recovery Leverage: Capitalizing on the post-recession recovery in travel demand, Delta expanded services in key markets.
These strategies collectively contributed to Delta’s profitability, distinguishing it in the airline industry throughout the period.

### Total Operating Profit or Loss by Airline and Region
![Figure 5 US Top 4 Airlines’ Total Operating Profit/Loss by Region from 2002 to 2023](https://MinShiMia.github.io/US-Top4-Airlines-Analytics/Tables_Figures/TotOpePro_carr_region.png)
 
Based on Figure 5, it is evident that Delta Air Lines has been the most profitable airline over the past twenty years, achieving higher earnings relative to costs in all four regions: domestic, local, across the Pacific, and across the Atlantic. Among these regions, Delta generated the highest profits from domestic operations, followed by the Atlantic, Pacific, and local flights.

Southwest is the second most profitable airline, operating solely in domestic and local markets. Remarkably, 95% of its profits come from domestic flights, while local flights contribute just about 5%.

United Airlines ranks third in profitability, with the most substantial earnings from Atlantic routes. It also profits from domestic and Pacific operations but incurs some losses in local flights.

American Airlines, meanwhile, is the least profitable among the top four, with overall negative profits. Specifically, it faces substantial losses in domestic operations and also records losses in Pacific and Atlantic routes. Its only profit comes from local flights.
